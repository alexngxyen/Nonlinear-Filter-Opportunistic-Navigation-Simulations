# Nonlinear-Filter-Simulations
This repository implements various nonlinear state estimators (e.g., Kalman filter and particle filter variants) in Python. For these simulations, a vehicle is assumed to be performing sensor fusion via the opportunistic navigation framework using ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs) exclusively, i.e., no use of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals, in a two-dimensional (planar) environment.
