# Nonlinear-Filter-Simulations
This repository implements various nonlinear state estimators (e.g., Kalman filter and particle filter variants) in Python. For these simulations, a vehicle is assumed to be performing opportunistic navigation with ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs) in a two-dimensional (planar) environment.
